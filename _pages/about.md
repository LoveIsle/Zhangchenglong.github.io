<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>


Currently, I am working toward the M.Sc. degree under the advisory of Professor Weiguo Sheng and Associate Professor Bingbing Jiang, with the School of Information Science and Technology, Hangzhou Normal University, Zhejiang, China. 
In 2022, I  received the B.Sc. degree from China Jiliang University, Zhejiang, China.

My research interests include multi-view learning, feature selection, and semi-supervised learning. Until now, I have published some research articles in machine learning and data mining, including IJCAI, TETCI, Information Fusion, and Information Sciences.
